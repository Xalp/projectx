unknown com struct game that has:

a few physical buttons
makes use of an arithmetic logic that has a boolean, addition, comparison and multiplier function
these buttons each contain a built-in led, which will light up, signalling the user to press. more than 1 button can light up together 
the faster u complete more levels, the higher score you get, cuz score = someTimeFunction*#levelsCompleted
there is a "tap out" button which the player can request the facilitator to activate in order to stop the game and take the last completed level as the highest score.
